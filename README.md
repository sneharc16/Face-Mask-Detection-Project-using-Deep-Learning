# Project: face-mask-detect-cvdl
This project was created by Sneha Roychowdhury as a part of our Internship Project at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Delhi, under the Computer Vision and Deep Learning Branch

## Problem Identification
In high-security areas, identifying individuals who wear masks for concealment is crucial for theft control and ensuring safety. Simultaneously, in regions facing infectious disease outbreaks like MPox or Coronavirus, monitoring mask usage is essential for public health management. Our ML model addresses both scenarios by accurately detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask. This dual functionality allows organizations to adapt the model to their specific needs, enhancing security measures or promoting health protocols as required.

## Model Building and Technologies Used
### We used the following tech stacks for the building of this model
#### TensorFlow: 
A popular open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning. It provides the foundation for building and training neural networks.
#### Keras: 
A high-level API built on top of TensorFlow (or other backends) that simplifies the creation and training of deep learning models.
#### NumPy: 
Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, essential for numerical computations in machine learning.
#### Pandas: 
Offers data structures and functions for data manipulation and analysis.
#### OpenCV: 
A library for real-time computer vision, often used for image and video processing tasks.
#### Matplotlib: 
A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
#### Seaborn: 
A higher-level interface for creating attractive statistical graphics based on Matplotlib.
#### PIL (Pillow): 
Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork, used for handling image files and basic image manipulation.
